## Learning-ddd

This proyect follows the event driven architure and it has composed by two microservices and one library. Moreover, each microservice have created with the domain driven desing approach. 

Microservices:
1. **Input-data**, it has the responsibility of process data of the users.
2. **Dashboard**, itÂ´s purpose is transforming the user-data and presenting the results.

Libraries:
1. **Shared**, It contains the common code for the microservices.

The purpose of this project is **improving technical and soft skills**:
1.  Inproving writting and reading english level.
2.  Practising with architectures like event driven and domain driven design.
3. Building this project let the opportuniy of playing with deploys in plataforms like AWS.
4. Enjoying with docker.
5. Increasing the understood of gradle.
6. Learning rabbitMq.

2. Execute --> docker-compose up -d
 ```
docker-compose up -d
```
3. RabbitMQ is running in --> http://localhost:8090/  --> user: rabbitmq, password: 2020

  **-Deploy Input-data postgresql**:
1. Open cmd in the proyect and go to input-data folder
```
cd input-data
```
2. Execute docker-compose up -d
```
docker-compose up -d
```
3. Postgresql is running in localhost:15432, user: postgres, password: 2020
4. Enter in database and execute the initional script, it is located in input-data/src/main/resources/db/migration

  **-Deploy Dashboard postgresql**:
1. Open cmd in the proyect and go to dashboard folder
```
cd dashboard
```
2. Execute docker-compose up -d
```
docker-compose up -d
```
3. Postgresql is running in localhost:15433, user: postgres, password: 2020
4. Enter in database and execute the initional script, it is located in dashboard/src/main/resources/db/migration

### Deploying microservices

Steps :
1. Build Shared library
```
cd shared 
gradlew clean
gradlew build
```
2. Build Microservice (Example: Input-data)
```
cd input-data 
gradlew clean
gradlew build
```
3. Run microservice
```
gradlew bootRun
```

Input-data --> Running in localhost:8081<br />
Dashboard --> Running in localhost:8082
