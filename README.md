## Learning-ddd

This proyect follows the event driven architure and it has composed by two microservices and a library. Moreover, each microservice have created with the domain driven desing approach. 

Microservices:
1. **Input-data**, it has the responsibility of process data of the users.
2. **Dashboard**, itÂ´s purpose is transforming the user-data and presenting the results.

Libraries:
1. **Shared**, It contains the common code for the microservices.

The purpose of this project is **improving technical and soft skills**:
1.  Inproving writting and reading english level.
2.  Practising with architectures like event driven and domain driven design.
3. Building this project let the opportuniy of playing with deploys in plataforms like AWS.
4. Enjoying with docker.
5. Increasing the understood of gradle.
6. Learning rabbitMq.
