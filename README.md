## Learning-ddd

This project follows the event driven architecture and it has composed by two microservices and one library. Moreover, each microservice have created with the domain driven design approach. 

Microservices:
1. **Input-data**, it has the responsibility of process data of the users.
2. **Dashboard**, itÂ´s purpose is transforming the user-data and presenting the results.

Libraries:
1. **Shared**, It contains the common code for the microservices.

The purpose of this project is **improving technical and soft skills**:
1.  Improving writing and reading English level.
2.  Practicing with architectures like event driven and domain driven design.
3. Building this project let the opportunity of playing with deploys in platforms like AWS.
4. Enjoying with docker.
5. Increasing the understood of gradle.
6. Learning rabbitMq.

## Deploy in local environment

### Requirements
* Docker --> https://www.docker.com/get-started
* Git --> https://git-scm.com/
* Gradle --> https://gradle.org/
* Open-jdk11 
    * https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/JDKUpdates/JDK11u
    * https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk11-upstream-binaries/releases/tag/jdk-11.0.12%2B7
 

### Docker general environment requirements:
  **-Deploy rabbitMQ**:
1. Open cmd in the project 
2. Execute --> docker-compose up -d
 ```
docker-compose up -d
```
3. RabbitMQ is running in --> http://localhost:8090/  --> user: rabbitmq, password: 2020

  **-Deploy Input-data postgresql**:
1. Open cmd in the project and go to input-data folder
```
cd input-data
```
2. Execute docker-compose up -d
```
docker-compose up -d
```
3. Postgresql is running in localhost:15432, user: postgres, password: 2020
4. Enter in database and execute the initial script, it is located in input-data/src/main/resources/db/migration

  **-Deploy Dashboard postgresql**:
1. Open cmd in the project and go to dashboard folder
```
cd dashboard
```
2. Execute docker-compose up -d
```
docker-compose up -d
```
3. Postgresql is running in localhost:15433, user: postgres, password: 2020
4. Enter in database and execute the initial script, it is located in dashboard/src/main/resources/db/migration

### Deploying microservices

Steps :
1. Build Shared library
```
cd shared 
gradlew clean
gradlew build
```
2. Build Microservice (Example: Input-data)
```
cd input-data 
gradlew clean
gradlew build
```
3. Run microservice
```
gradlew bootRun
```

Input-data --> Running in localhost:8081<br />
Dashboard --> Running in localhost:8082
